# Deep-Learning-Summer-School_University-of-Tehran
Contains all assignments in summer school.

# implementation and Environment
All assignments are in python and implemented in Jupyter Notebook.
I used Google Colab for speeding up training because of powerful Nvidia GPUs on Google Cloud. please visit <span <a href ="acm.ut.ac.ir/deeplearning">colab.resreach.google.com</a></span>

# Topics
Fully Connected Neural Network,Convolutional Neural Network, Recurrent Neural Network, Generative Adversarial Network and some preprocessing.

 # Notice
 Because this assignment should be evaluated, I had to use proposed method and do not do restricted methods or functions. So there may be   alot of ways to this assignmens or better ways!

# Refrence
All assignments provided by University of Tehran,ACM group with title <strong>UTDLSS2</strong>.
